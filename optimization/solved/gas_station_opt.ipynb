    "# Gas Station Optimization Problem\n",
    "#### _Edward Krueger, edkrueger@gmail.com_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn how to modularize a simulation so that we can seach over different inputs to find an optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have completed Alice's simulation, she want you to answer her over all question: How many pumps should she have at her gas station. She wants to know how many pumps are needed to maximize gallons sold.  In order to do this we will impove on the code from the Gas Station Simulation Problem. Feel free to use either your own code or the code in the solution as a starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulate the Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to rewrite the simulation as a encapsulated function that takes every varible the simulation needs to run as an argument. This will require that for every function or object, the parameters are passed explicitly as arguments; rather than being read as global varialbes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will allow us to easily see the effect of gas pumps on the number of gallons sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "* We can either eliminate the print statement of include a flag telling whether or not the simulation should print results. The simulation and optimization will run much faster if they don't have to print and the output will be much cleaner.\n",
    "* Since we are only focused on the number of gallons sold, we don't need the other metrics. Since the GasStation instance keeps track of all of the gas sold, we don't need to save the Car instances in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulate for Different Numbers of Pumps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now since we have a function that returns the simulated number of gallons sold, we can to run this function for a number of values to see its results."
